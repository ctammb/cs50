Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, probabilities were not as spread across multiple countries. However, as more countries were represented, some teams with 0.0% chance of winning appeared

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Predictions seemed to have proper rpresentation at around 1000 simulations and runtime was similar to much smaller numbers of simulations.
